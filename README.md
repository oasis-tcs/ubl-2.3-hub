## Further Description of this Repository

Distributions for UBL 2.0 through 2.3 have comprised two main collections of information, the documentation and the artefacts.

This repository is for the documentation with which the resulting distribution is built incorporating artefacts:
- assembly of edited material into distributed material
- publishing of distributed material in its consumable forms
- integrity checking of the self-consistency of distributed materials

See https://github.com/oasis-tcs/ubl-2.3-artefacts for the artefacts. Note that this publishing process presumes that the artefacts have been created already in the same target directory as is used for the hub results, with the same stage and label values as passed here for hub results, thus matching the artefacts with the document to produce the result.

Entities generated in the building of the artefacts:
- `old2newDocBook-UBL-2.3-csprd03-UBL-2.2-documents-ent.xml`
- `old2newDocBook-UBL-2.3-csprd03-UBL-2.2-library-ent.xml`
- `old2newDocBook-UBL-2.3-csprd03-UBL-2.3-csprd02-documents-ent.xml`
- `old2newDocBook-UBL-2.3-csprd03-UBL-2.3-csprd02-library-ent.xml`

Source files, processing stylesheets, and resulting entities generated in the building of the hub document:
- `UBL-2.2.xml` and `UBL.xml` processed by `hub2processSummary.xsl`:
  - `summary-processes-ent.xml`
- `UBL-2.3-Party-summary-information.xml` processed by `partydoc2db.xsl`:
  - `summary-parties-ent.xml`
- `UBL-2.3-Schema-summary-information.xml` processed by `schemadoc2db.xsl`:
  - `summary-namespaces-ent.xml`
  - `summary-schemas-ent.xml`
  - `summary-examples-ent.xml`

The artefacts must have already been created in the target directory, and they must have the same stage and label as the process invocation for the creation of the documentation and final results:
- input artefacts:
  - `artefacts-UBL-2.3-{stage}-{label}.zip`

Support subdirectories:
- [`art`]( art ) - high-res PNG artwork for print publishing (max width: 5.7in/14.5cm)
  - at a resolution of 600dpi: max width: 3425 pixels
  - at a resolution of 400dpi: max width: 2283 pixels
  - at a resolution of 300dpi (minimum): max width: 1713 pixels
- [`db`]( db ) - XML on-the-fly rendering runtime environment for DocBook from OASIS DocBook templates
- [`htmlart`]( htmlart ) - low-res PNG artwork for web publishing (max width: 750 pixels)
- [`images`]( images ) - original revisable source vector artwork in `.svg` or `.drawio` (incomplete set of files because many originals have been lost; please add originals here using same base name as published; PNG images in the `art/` and `htmlart/` subdirectories must be made manually)
- [`utilities`]( utilities ) - tools used to generate outputs

The build process is:
- `publishUBL23Docs.bat   ..\results stage label localDateTime {serverUsername serverPassword}`
- `sh publishUBL23Docs.sh ../results stage label localDateTime {serverUsername serverPassword}`
  - pre-existing target directory (without trailing "/")
  - stage (e.g. "csd02wd03", "csprd01", "os", etc., or any string for testing purposes e.g. "test")
  - label (e.g. "CCYYMMDD-hhmmz" UTC time as in "20200406-0250z", or any string for testing purposes e.g. "test")
  - localDateTime (e.g. "now" for current time, or "CCYYMMDD-hhmm" in local time as in "20200405-2250z" for EDT -0400)
  - serverUsername (for those editors with publishing privileges)
  - serverPassword (for those editors with publishing privileges)

- examples:
  - dry run without publishing - `publishUBL23Docs.bat ..\results test test now`
  - dry run with publishing - `publishUBL23Docs.bat ..\results test test now serveruser serverpass`
  - final run with publishing - `publishUBL23Docs.bat ..\results csprd03 20200511-1720z 20200511-1320`

IMPORTANT NOTE!
- without publishing privileges, the PDF and HTML files are not updated, but the process continues through completion for the purposes of consistency checking
- opening the resulting UBL-2.3.xml in an XSLT-aware browser (e.g. Safari) allows one to peruse the final document as if it had been published in HTML

The build result in the target directory:
- `hub-UBL-2.3-{stage}-{label}.zip`
- `hub-UBL-2.3-{stage}-{label}/`
- `UBL-2.3-{stage}-{label}.zip`
- `UBL-2.3-{stage}-{label}/`
